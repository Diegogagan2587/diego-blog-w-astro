Bearer Token in Spanish would mean "Token al portador".
The Bearer Token is a cryptic string usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making request to protected resources.

- They are commonly used with the OAuth 2.0 protocol
- The Bearer token is typically included in the "Authorization" header of an HTTP request
- The word "Bearer" is appended before the token in the "Authorization" header to identify it is a Bearer token, as it serves as an identificator.

Example `Authorization: Bearer laksjdfj3243234243`
