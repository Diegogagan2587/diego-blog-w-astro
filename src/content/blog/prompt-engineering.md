## 1. **What Prompt Engineering Actually Is**

It‚Äôs not magic spells. It‚Äôs structured communication.  
You‚Äôre basically writing **specifications for an AI**, but in plain text ‚Äî telling it what you want, how you want it, and what to avoid.

Think:

- **Prompt** = mini-PRD
    
- **Good prompt** = saves time, avoids ‚ÄúAI hallucination‚Äù
    
- **Bad prompt** = vague meeting notes from that one coworker
    

---

## 2. **Core Formula**

Most powerful prompts have four parts:

1. **Role / Context**  
    Give the AI an identity or POV.  
    _Example:_ ‚ÄúYou are a senior Rails developer specializing in API performance tuning.‚Äù
    
2. **Task / Goal**  
    Say exactly what you want it to do.  
    _Example:_ ‚ÄúRefactor the following controller for speed.‚Äù
    
3. **Constraints**  
    Define style, format, limits, and no-gos.  
    _Example:_ ‚ÄúDo not remove any existing features. Return code only.‚Äù
    
4. **Examples / Reference** _(optional but killer)_  
    Give a ‚Äúgolden example‚Äù so it copies the style.  
    _Example:_ ‚ÄúFollow this pattern: ‚Ä¶‚Äù

## 3. **Prompt Types You‚Äôll Use Most**

- **Instructional**: Tell it exactly what to do.
    
- **Chain-of-thought** _(structured reasoning)_: Break big questions into smaller sub-questions for it.
    
- **Few-shot prompting**: Give it 2‚Äì3 good examples to follow.
    
- **Persona prompting**: Assign it a role so it thinks like a specific type of expert.
    
- **Iterative prompting**: Ask, get draft, refine with follow-ups.

## 4. **Techniques to Level Up**

- **Be absurdly specific**: ‚ÄúExplain WebSockets‚Äù is vague. ‚ÄúExplain WebSockets to a junior developer in 4 bullet points with a cooking analogy‚Äù will be üî•.
    
- **Force structure**: ‚ÄúReply in a table with columns: Step, Action, Expected Output.‚Äù
    
- **Tell it what to avoid**: ‚ÄúDo not add extra commentary.‚Äù
    
- **Ask for step-by-step reasoning** (but don‚Äôt say ‚Äúthink step-by-step‚Äù in production docs if you want concise results).
    
- **Break complex tasks into stages**: Like how you‚Äôd do in agile dev.
    

---

## 5. **Debugging Bad Outputs**

When AI gives junk, try:

- Adding **context** (‚ÄúThis is for a SaaS product onboarding flow‚Äù)
    
- Tightening **constraints** (‚ÄúNo more than 150 words, plain English‚Äù)
    
- Showing **good and bad examples** side-by-side
    
- Using **follow-ups** instead of restarting (‚ÄúKeep everything but fix section 3‚Ä¶‚Äù)

## 6. **Mini Cheat Sheet**

|Situation|Prompt Trick|
|---|---|
|Writing code|Give version, language, and constraints (‚ÄúRails 8, no gem outside stdlib, keep method names‚Äù)|
|Summarizing docs|‚ÄúBullet points, max 5, sorted by importance‚Äù|
|Creating ideas|‚ÄúGenerate 10 options, rank them by feasibility‚Äù|
|Complex logic|‚ÄúFirst explain the approach, then give the final output‚Äù|
|Teaching you|‚ÄúExplain like I‚Äôm 12, then explain like I‚Äôm a senior dev‚Äù|
