**Prompt for Solving Complex Technical Issues with AI:**

---

> **Context:**
> I’m experiencing a specific technical issue (for example, configuring ESLint v9 with Flat Config in an Astro + React project). I've already tried multiple standard solutions, none of which have worked. I need you to deeply diagnose the problem and provide a clear, thoroughly tested, and definitive solution.
>
> **Conditions for responding (mandatory):**
>
> * **Before suggesting a solution**, analyze the issue step-by-step and clearly explain the exact root cause of the specific error I'm encountering.
> * **Do NOT repeat** previous solutions or minor variations without explicitly explaining why they would now work differently.
> * If you don’t immediately know the solution, explicitly follow this iterative process:
>
>   1. Clearly describe your current understanding of the issue.
>   2. Identify and explain possible root causes (at least three distinct hypotheses).
>   3. Logically test each hypothesis one by one, explicitly detailing how to validate or invalidate each.
>   4. Only after you find a clearly valid hypothesis, propose a detailed, step-by-step solution that definitively resolves the issue.
> * **Never** assume I have the correct dependencies, files, or configurations in place; always instruct me precisely on how to verify them from scratch.
> * If your initial response doesn’t solve the problem, you're explicitly forbidden from repeating similar answers. Force yourself to generate **radically new ideas** or completely different diagnostic methods.
>
> **Your goal:**
> Find a precise, definitive solution regardless of the number of iterations needed. Do not stop or repeat previously failed attempts. If you can’t immediately solve the problem, give me explicit instructions on how to gather more useful information so you can continue analyzing the issue until it’s fully resolved.

This prompt compels any AI to:

* Fully understand the problem before proposing superficial solutions.
* Explicitly consider multiple possible root causes and validate them.
* Avoid the common trap of repeating ineffective answers.
* Work iteratively with you, detailing each step clearly until arriving at the definitive solution.

Use this whenever you face complex issues and want to push the AI past superficial responses into genuine problem-solving.
