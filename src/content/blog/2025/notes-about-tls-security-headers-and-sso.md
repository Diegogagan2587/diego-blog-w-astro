In modern web development, security is no longer optional ‚Äî 
it's expected. Whether you're working on an internal dashboard or building production-grade SaaS 
tools, understanding the essentials of **TLS, HTTP security headers, authentication protocols like 
OAuth/SAML, and compliance baselines** is a must. Let‚Äôs walk through the key concepts and how to 
implement or validate them in a typical Rails + Coolify deployment setup. ---
## üîê TLS: What It Is and How to Check It
**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** ensures that data traveling between a user‚Äôs browser and your 
server is encrypted. Today, **TLS 1.2** is the minimum accepted version; TLS 1.3 is even better.
### How to check your TLS version:
- Go to: [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest) - Enter your domain (e.g., 
`https://reportes.detucel.com`) - Look for ‚ÄúProtocol Support‚Äù ‚Üí You want to see **TLS 1.2** and **TLS 
1.3** listed. If you use **Coolify** with Let's Encrypt, you're already covered. TLS is enforced 
automatically, and you get a green padlock on your domain. ---
## üß± Understanding HTTP Security Headers
Your app might have TLS, but that doesn't protect it from **client-side attacks like XSS or 
clickjacking**. That‚Äôs where HTTP headers come in. Here are the most important headers and what they 
do:


| Header | What it does | Importance | 
|--------|--------------|------------| 
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | Forces the browser to always use HTTPS | High | 
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | Blocks MIME sniffing | High | 
| `X-Frame-Options` | Prevents your site from being embedded in iframes | High |
| `Referrer-Policy` | Limits how much URL info is shared | Medium | 
| `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` | Prevents XSS by whitelisting sources | üî• Extremely High | 
| `Permissions-Policy` | Controls access to APIs like camera, mic, geolocation | Medium |


### How to check your headers:
Use [https://securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com) to scan your site. If you're getting a 
**grade B**, you're on the right track ‚Äî but a couple headers are still missing (like CSP or 
Permissions-Policy). ---
## üõ† Implementing Missing Headers in Rails
### Add Content Security Policy:
In Rails, add this in `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`: ```ruby 
Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|
  policy.default_src :self policy.script_src :self, :https policy.style_src :self, :https 
  policy.img_src :self, :data, :https policy.font_src :self, :https policy.object_src :none
end ````
### Add Permissions Policy:
Use `secure_headers` gem or inject manually via middleware. Example: ```ruby response.set_header( 
  'Permissions-Policy', 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()'
) ``` ---
## üßæ What is NIST SP 800-52?
This U.S. government guideline mandates that systems use strong encryption and configurations (like 
TLS 1.2+). You **don‚Äôt have to comply unless you work in regulated environments** (e.g., government, 
fintech, healthcare), but following it is smart for any serious deployment. NIST says: * Use **TLS 1.2 
or higher** * Use **strong ciphers (e.g., AES-GCM, CHACHA20)** * Disable legacy protocols (e.g., SSL, 
TLS 1.0/1.1) * Validate certificate chains properly If your site passes SSL Labs with a grade A and 
uses TLS 1.2+, you're mostly aligned already. ---
## üîê What about OAuth and SAML?

These are **authentication protocols** used in Single Sign-On (SSO) systems.

| Protocol | Purpose | 
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | 
| OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect | Used in modern apps (e.g., ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù) |
| SAML | Used in  corporate/government environments |


Your app **doesn‚Äôt need to support these by default**, but it's smart to **build support for OAuth 
providers** if you‚Äôre planning B2B features or enterprise onboarding. Tools like `omniauth`, `devise`, 
and `doorkeeper` make this relatively simple in Rails. ---
## ‚úÖ Minimum Viable Security Setup
If you're short on time or budget, aim for this baseline: * ‚úÖ HTTPS enforced (TLS 1.2+) * ‚úÖ 
`Strict-Transport-Security` * ‚úÖ `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` * ‚úÖ 
`Content-Security-Policy` * ‚úÖ Weekly or daily VPS backups * ‚úÖ Documented recovery process (even if 
basic) * ‚úÖ No raw card data handled unless PCI-DSS is in place ---
## ‚úçÔ∏è Final Tips
* You don‚Äôt need perfect security, but you **do need visible, measurable practices**. * Clients and 
auditors love seeing security headers and policies. * Use automated tools like `Brakeman` (Rails) and 
`securityheaders.com` regularly. * Keep all secrets, tokens, and credentials in environment variables 
‚Äî not in the codebase. --- This guide is meant to serve as a **battle-tested checklist and reference** 
for web developers who deploy with confidence and want to avoid getting caught off guard by basic 
security gaps. Need a CSP template, middleware snippet, or a fallback plan for outages? Reach out ‚Äî or 
better yet, build it into your process before someone else finds the gap.
