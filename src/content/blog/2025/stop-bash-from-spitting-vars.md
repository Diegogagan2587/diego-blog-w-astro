# üß† Bash Debugging Case Study: Why Does My Terminal Print All `declare -x` Environment Variables?

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Symptom

Every time I opened a new terminal in **Elementary OS 7.1 (based on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS)**, my shell printed dozens of lines like:

```sh
declare -x CLUTTER_IM_MODULE="ibus"
declare -x COLORTERM="truecolor"
declare -x DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus"
...
```

It looked like a full dump of all environment variables. It happened **every single time I opened the terminal**, and even after a system reboot.

---

## üß† Root Cause (TL;DR)

I had this line in my `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export
```

This command, when run on its own, prints **all current exported environment variables** in the format:

```bash
declare -x VAR="value"
```

So every time Bash read that file (e.g., on terminal launch), it executed the `export` line and printed the entire environment ‚Äî unintentionally.

---

## üß™ How It Got There

Most likely I ran:

```bash
export
```

in the terminal at some point, and maybe copy-pasted or redirected output without realizing. Later, it might have been appended to `.bashrc` by mistake (especially if running something like `history >> ~/.bashrc` or manually editing).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How I Fixed It

### Step 1: Open `.bashrc` for editing

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 2: Look for a standalone `export` command

```bash
export       # ‚Üê THIS is the problem
export DATABASE_PASSWORD="halo2587"  # ‚Üê This one is fine (but may be insecure)
```

### Step 3: Delete or comment the problematic line

```bash
# export       ‚Üê commented or removed
```

### Step 4: Save and exit

* `Ctrl+O` ‚Üí Save
* `Enter` ‚Üí Confirm filename
* `Ctrl+X` ‚Üí Exit

### Step 5: Reload or reopen your terminal

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now everything runs clean ‚Äî no more `declare -x` spam.

---

## üßØ Bonus: Preventing It in the Future

* Never leave `export` alone in your config files.

* Use `grep` to quickly check:

  ```bash
  grep -E '^export\s*$' ~/.bashrc
  ```

* If you see `export` with no variable name ‚Üí it's wrong.

* Keep secrets (like `DATABASE_PASSWORD`) out of `.bashrc`. Use a `.env` file or a secrets manager instead.

---

## üßò Final Thoughts

This was a great debugging session involving:

* `bash -ix` to trace shell execution.
* `strace` to track which files Bash loads.
* `grep` and detective-level digging into shell behavior.

If your terminal suddenly prints too much, especially `declare -x`, remember: **look for an orphaned `export`**.
