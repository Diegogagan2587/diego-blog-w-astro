Today I've been watching some videos on youtube, and below there are some notes i've found usefull


## Look for what you are good at, and find it.

You might like to be a pilot of an F11, but if you use glasees, it might not be posible,
thats why you have to find what you are good at, (not necesary, what you love to do), you should find
4 skills you are good at then use them, conect the dots, and use them to make money.

## Dedicate everything to a Job.

The way you do small thing, is the way you do the big things.

doing the bare minimun is somthing that should never be celebrated. so you should put effort
in work, the goal is not to waste your time, but to use it wisely to learn withing each job.
it's important to try to figure out what things are as they are.
take notes of everything

## Nurture your contacts and your image.

YOu have to have a good image, so you can connect to the people you want to conect, so it's importatn to keep
a clean image. this is not only for your looking, but also for the impact you leave in people.

do not say to you you are great, practice how to be greate, having proof of it is better than just said.

## identify improvements and write it down.

Business are about solving problems,but business have it's own problems, so take note about the issues/challenges you face,
and take note about how you solve it. so in short you get paid while you gain knowledge. taking nots of it not only helps you to document everthing, 
but to remeber to your self what you have been doing, waht you werer able to solve, this will gives you
motivation when you face a difficult problem couse you will remember how many prblmes you have solved.
its basicly what a consultant would do, implemnt and learn by error, except that you would be getting paid for it.

## Test your fixes with a side hustle

it's important to measure, because, what cannot be measure, cannot be managed. it's like in code. we would not deployed in production
but we would do it in staging enviroment. this is a reazon why athletes measure their stats. so the can improve.

another tool is,a MVP( minimal viable product), you can create an MVP and then ask for feedback. you can ask for feedback to the 
peoplo you sell your product,or sell it in small scale and then get that feedback.

## Launch your business


it's important to bring value to a huge amount of peoplo. so we need to ask how can we do things on large scale. this is
where we thing that somthing should be scalable.
