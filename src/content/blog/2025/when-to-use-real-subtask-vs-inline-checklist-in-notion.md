Notion gives you two main ways to break down tasks:

1. ✅ **Real Subtasks** (linked database items / sub-items)
2. ✅ **Inline Checklists** (`- [ ]` inside the task description)

Understanding **when to use each** is key to managing your projects effectively—especially when you're handling important clients  or complex PROJECTS implementations.

### 🔧 Summary: How to Decide

| Type                               | When to Use It                                                                  | What It Enables                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ **Real Subtasks (linked items)** | When you need to **assign, track, schedule, or reference** a step independently | Set assignees, due dates, statuses, dependencies |
| ✅ **Inline Checklist (`- [ ]`)**   | For **quick internal steps** that don't require tracking or separate visibility | A simple visual guide within the main task body  |

---

### ✅ Use **Real Subtasks** when:

* The step needs its **own assignee**, **due date**, or **status**
* You want to see it in your **Calendar**, **Board**, or **Timeline views**
* It’s an **actionable deliverable**, not just a reminder
* The step is **critical for tracking project progress**

> **Example:** For a task like *"Use Case Alignment with Client"*, you may have:
>
> * `Schedule Alignment Meeting`
> * `Prepare Use Case Table`
> * `Update CRD after Meeting`
> * `Document Final Use Cases for Flow Design`

All of these could be modeled as proper subtasks with individual properties.

---

### ✅ Use **Inline Checklists (`- [ ]`)** when:

* The steps are **only relevant to you**
* They take **minutes to complete** and don’t need delegation
* They’re part of a **routine workflow** that doesn't need project-level visibility
* You want a **quick breakdown** for clarity

> **Example:** Inside the task *“Align Use Cases with Client”*, you might add:

```markdown
Checklist:
- [ ] Add proposed use cases to CRD
- [ ] Share table with client
- [ ] Confirm agreement in meeting
- [ ] Summarize decisions in follow-up email
```

## 🧠 Pro-level Guidelines

| Situation                           | Use Real Subtask | Use Inline Checklist |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Another person needs to complete it | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No                 |
| You’ll do it in 5 minutes           | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes                |
| Needs to show up in Calendar/Kanban | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No                 |
| It’s a checklist for internal logic | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes                |
| Repeated in every ATIA-type project | ✅ Templateable   | ✅ Optional           |

## 🎯 Final Thought

> **Use subtasks for execution.**
> **Use checklists for guidance.**

This balance keeps your system **clean, trackable, and professional**, without cluttering your dashboard with micro-tasks that don't need to exist.
