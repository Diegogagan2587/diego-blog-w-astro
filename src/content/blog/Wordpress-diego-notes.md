### What is the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org?

- **WordPress.org** is an open-source platform that allows you to build and fully customize your own website. You need to provide your own hosting.
    
- **WordPress.com** is the official hosting service for WordPress. They offer different plans like Personal, Premium, and Business, with hosting and maintenance included.

### WordPress on Localhost

I currently have WordPress installed locally using **XAMPP**. To access the site:

1. First, you need to [start XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/faq_linux.html#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20start%20XAMPP%3F).
    
2. Then, open the URL where WordPress is installed.
    

If you donâ€™t remember which port XAMPP is running on, use the command below to list active services and their ports:

```sh
ss -nltp
```

By default, your local WordPress site might be available at:

- `http://localhost:85/wordpress/`
    
- or `http://localhost:85/wordpress/wp-admin`
